In short, we spent $2038.89 â€” almost half of which was the $990 from the Park Police.  We took in $1371.90 ($429.82 of which came from donations from people on this list).  The difference is currently made up by me and Darby.  I know many of you had offered to donate some of that difference -- you're welcome to do so (and if you do it as a personal transaction on Paypal rather than going through the donate link, it shouldn't charge you a fee).  I'd certainly appreciate it; but you're certainly not under any obligation to do so.  You did a great job, and I appreciate all your hard work.  Thanks again for making this a great SurviveDC.  :)
